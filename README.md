# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The project first calls upon weatherapi to get json data based on the zipcode input of the user. It is then sent in a post route with the users feelings along with the zipcode entered. We then finally call our UI update function which uses all the data to create new entries with information from the user and openweather api.
